SSL Basics
The SSL protocol aims to provide solutions to two simple security problems:

How can we securely transmit data between two parties in such a way that only the two parties can read it?
How can one (or more) of the parties involved prove that they are actually the entity we want to grant the ability to decrypt our encrypted transmission?
